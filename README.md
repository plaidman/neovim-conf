this config started as a [kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim), so following the readme there to start is a good idea

## MacOS
- brew install `go`, `fd`, `ripgrep`
- install these files to `~/.config/nvim/*`.
- run nvim
- if fzf fails to install, go into `~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/telescope-fzf-native.nvim/` and run make
- :Mason to install LSPs
